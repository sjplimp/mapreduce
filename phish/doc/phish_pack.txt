[Description:]

These are PHISH library functions which can be called from a minnow
application.  In PHISH lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone application
which makes calls to the "PHISH library"_Library.html.

These functions are used to pack data into a datum before sending it
to another minnow.

As discussed in "this section"_Library.html#datum of the "PHISH
Library"_Library.html doc page, datums sent and recived by the PHISH
library contain one or more fields.  A field is a fundamental data
type, such as an "int" or vector of "doubles" or a NULL-terminated
character string.  These pack functions (except for pack_datum()) add
a single field to a datum by packing data into a contiguous byte
string, using integer flags to indicate what type and length of data
comes next.  "Unpack"_phish_unpack.html functions allow the minnow to
extract data from the datum, one field at a time.

Once data has been packed, the minnow may re-use the memory that
stores the data; the pack functions copy the data into a send buffer.

The pack_datum() function

A minnow can build the structure of a datum itself, using the
information "this section"_Library.html#datum of the "PHISH
Library"_Library.html doc page.  But the more common usage is to use
this function to pack a datum just received and unpacked via the
"phish_datum"_phish_unpack.html function, so that it can be sent as-is
to another minnow.

The remaining pack functions correspond one-to-one with the kinds of
fundamental data that can be packed into a PHISH datum:

phish_pack_raw() = pack a string of raw bytes of length {n}
phish_pack_byte() = pack a single character
phish_pack_int() = pack a single int
phish_pack_uint64() = pack a single unsigned 64-bit int
phish_pack_double() = pack a single double
phish_pack_string() = pack a C-style NULL-terminated string of bytes
phish_pack_int_array() = pack {n} int values from {ivec}
phish_pack_uint64_array() = pack {n} uint64 values from {uvec}
phish_pack_double_array() = pack {n} double values from {dvec} :ul

Phish_pack_raw() can be used with whatever string of raw bytes the
minnow puts into the {buf} argument, e.g. a C data structure
containing a collection of various C primitive data types.  The "int"
data type refers to a signed int, typically 32-bits in length.  The
"uint64" data type refers to an unsigned 64-bit int.
Phish_pack_string() will pack a standard C-style NULL-terminated 
string of bytes.  The array pack functions exepct the
{ivec} or {uvec} or {dvec} pointer to point to a contiguous
vector of "int" or "uint64" or "double" values.
