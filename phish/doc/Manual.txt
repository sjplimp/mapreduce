PHISH Documentation :h2,c

Version info: :h4

The PHISH "version" is the date when it was released, such as 1 Sept
2012.  PHISH is updated continuously.  Whenever we fix a bug or add a
feature, we release it immediately, and post a notice on "this page of
the WWW site"_bug.  Each dated copy of PHISH contains all the features
and bug-fixes up to and including that version date.  The version date
is printed to the screen every time you run the bait.py tool on a
PHISH input script.  It is also in the PHISH directory name created
when you unpack a tarball.

If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages on the PHISH WWW site, they
always describe the most current version of PHISH. :ulb,l

If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages included in your tarball, they
describe the version you have. :ule,l

PHISH stands for Parallel Harness for Informatic Stream Hashing.

The PHISH package has two parts.  The first is a simple, portable
library that user-written programs can call to send and receive datums
to and from other programs, running on the same or different machines.
The second is a setup tool that allows specification of an algorithm
for performing a computation on data as a collection of independent
programs and communication patterns between them.  Input data to the
algorithm can be archived or arrive continuously in a streaming
fashion.

PHISH was developed at Sandia National Laboratories, a US Department
of Energy facility, with funding from the DOE.  It is an open-source
code, distributed freely under the terms of the "Berkeley Software
Distribution (BSD) License"_http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_license.

The authors of PHISH are Steve Plimpton and Tim Shead who can be
contacted at sjplimp, tshead at sandia.gov.  The "PHISH WWW Site"_pws
at http::/phish.sandia.gov has more information about the code and its
uses.
