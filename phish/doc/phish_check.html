<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is a PHISH library function which can be called from a minnow
application.  In PHISH lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone application
which makes calls to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH library</A>.
</P>
<P>This function is typically the final function called by a minnow
during its setup phase, after the minnow has defined its input and
output ports via the <A HREF = "phish_input.html">phish_input</A> and
<A HREF = "phish_output.html">phish_output</A> functions.  It must be called before
any datums are received or sent to other minnows.
</P>
<P>The function checks that the input and output ports defined by the
minnow are consistent with their usage in the PHISH input script, as
processed by the <A HREF = "Bait.html">bait.py</A> tool.
</P>
<P>Specifically, it does the following:
</P>
<UL><LI>checks that required input ports are used by the script
<LI>checks that no ports used by the script are undefined by the minnow
<LI>opens all ports used by the script so that data exchanges can begin 
</UL>
