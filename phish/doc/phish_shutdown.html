<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>These are PHISH library functions which can be called from a minnow
application.  In PHISH lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone application
which makes calls to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH library</A>.
</P>
<P>These functions serve to shutdown a running minnow, either entirely or
a portion of its output capabilities.  They trigger the closing of a
minnow's output port(s) which notifies downstream minnows, so they
also can clean-up and exit.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "Minnows.html#minnow_3">this section</A> of the <A HREF = "Minnows.html">Minnows</A>
doc page for a discussion of shutdown options for PHISH programs.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The phish_exit() function is the most commonly used mechanism for
performing an orderly shutdown of a PHISH program.  Once called, no
further calls to the PHISH library can be made by a minnow, so it is
often the final line of a minnow program.
</P>
<P>When phish_exit() is called it performs the following operations:
</P>
<UL><LI>warn if any input port is not closed
<LI>close all output ports
<LI>free internal memory allocated by the PHISH library
<LI>shutdown communication protocols to other minnows 
</UL>
<P>Closing a minnow's output port involves sending a "done" message to
each minnow (in each set of minnows) connected as a receiver to that
port, so that they know to expect no more datums from this minnow.
</P>
<P>When all the minnows in a set have invoked phish_exit() to close an
output port, each downstream minnow that receives output from this
port will have received a series of "done" messages on its
corresponding input port.  Each minnow keeps a count of the total # of
minnows that send to that port, so it will know when the requisite
number of done messages have been received to close the input port.
</P>
<P>In the MPI version of the library, the final step is performed by
invoking MPI_Finalize(), which means no further MPI calls can be made.
</P>
<P>NOTE: how is this done for the sockets version?
</P>
<P>Note that this function is often called directly by the most upstream
minnow(s) in a PHISH school, when they are done with their task
(e.g. reading data from a file).
</P>
<P>Other downstream minnows often call phish_exit() after the
<A HREF = "phish_recv.html">phish_loop</A> or <A HREF = "phish_recv.html">phish_probe</A> function
returns control to the minnow, since that only occurs when all the
minnow's input ports have been closed.  In this manner, the shutdown
procedure cascades from minnow to minnow.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The phish_close() function is less often used than the phish_exit()
function.  It can be useful when some minnow in the middle of a data
processing pipeline needs to trigger an orderly shutdown of the PHISH
program.
</P>
<P>Phish_close() closes the specified <I>iport</I> output port of a minnow.
This procedure involves sending a "done" message to each minnow (in
each set of minnows) connected as a receiver to that port, so that
they know to expect no more datums from this minnow.
</P>
<P>When all the minnows in a set have invoked phish_close() on an output
port, each downstream minnow that receives output from this port will
have received a series of "done" messages on its corresponding input
port.  Each minnow keeps a count of the total # of minnows that send
to that port, so it will know when the requisite number of done
messages have been received to close the input port.  As input ports
are closed, this typically triggers the minnow to invoke phish_exit()
or phish_close().  In this manner, the shutdown procedure cascades
from minnow to minnow.
</P>
<P>This function does nothing if the specified output port is already
closed.
