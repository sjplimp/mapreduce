<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>These are PHISH library functions which can be called from a minnow
application.  In PHISH lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone application
which makes calls to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH library</A>.
</P>
<P>These functions are used to receive datums sent by other minnows.
</P>
<P>Note that received datums can arrive on any input port the minnow
defines and the PHISH input script uses to route datums from one set
of minnows to another set.  The functions documented on this page
receive the next datum, whichever input port it arrives on.  It is up
to the minnow to take the appropriate port-specific action if
necessary.  This can be done by defining a port-specific callback
function via the <A HREF = "phish_port.html">phish_input</A> function.  Or by
querying what port the datum was received on via the
<A HREF = "phish_unpack.html">phish_datum</A> function.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The phish_loop() function turns control over to the PHISH library.  It
will wait for the next datum to arrive on any input port.  When it
does one of three things happen:
</P>
<P>(1) For a regular datum, phish_loop() will make a callback to the
minnow, to the <I>datum</I> callback function assigned to the input port
the datum was received on.  See the <A HREF = "phish_input.html">phish_input</A>
function for how this callback function is assigned.  When the
callback function returns, control is returned to phish_loop().
</P>
<P>(2) For a datum that signals the closure of an input port,
phish_loop() will make a callback to the minnow, to the <I>done</I>
callback function assigned to the input port the datum was received
on.  See the <A HREF = "phish_input.html">phish_input</A> function for how this
callback function is assigned.  When the callback function returns,
control is returned to phish_loop().
</P>
<P>(3) For a datum that closes the last open input port, step (2) is
performed, and then an additional callback to the minnow is made, to
the <I>alldone</I> callback function (optionally) assigned by the
<A HREF = "phish_done.html">phish_done</A> function.  When the callback function
returns, control is returned to phish_loop().
</P>
<P>After option (3) has occurred, phish_loop() returns, giving control
back to the minnow.  Typically, the minnow will then clean up and call
<A HREF = "phish_exit.html">phish_exit</A>, since all its input ports are closed and
no more datums can be received.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The phish_probe() function is identical to phish_loop(), except that
instead of waiting for the next datum to arrive, phish_probe() checks
if a datum has arrived.  If not, then it immediately calls the
specified <I>probefunc</I> callback function.  This allows the minnow to do
useful work while waiting for the next datum to arrive.
</P>
<P>The <I>probefunc</I> function should have the following form:
</P>
<PRE>void probefunc() {
} 
</PRE>
<P>where "datumfunc" is replaced by a function name of your choice.  When
the <I>probefunc</I> callback function returns, control is returned to
phish_probe().
</P>
<P>Note that just like phish_loop(), phish_probe() will not return
control to the minnow, until option (3) above has occured, i.e. all
input ports have been closed.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The phish_recv() function allows the minnow to request datums
explicitly, rather than be handing control to phish_loop() or
phish_probe() and being called back to by those functions.
</P>
<P>The phish_recv() function checks if a datum has arrived and returns
regardless.  It returns a value of 0 if no datum is available.  It
returns a value N > 0 if a datum has arrived, with N = the number of
fields in the datum.  See the <A HREF = "phish_unpack.html">phish_unpack</A> and
<A HREF = "phish_datum.html">phish_datum</A> doc pages for info on how the received
datum can be further processed.
</P>
<P>If a datum is received that signals the closure of an input port, then
phish_recv() will perform the same options (2) and (3) listed above,
making callbacks to the <I>done</I> callback function and <I>alldone</I>
callback function as appopriate, and then return with a value of -1.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>These functions can only be called after
<A HREF = "phish_check.html">phish_check</A> has been called.
