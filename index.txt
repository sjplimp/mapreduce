MapReduce-MPI Library :c,h3

This is the home page for the MapReduce-MPI (MR-MPI) library, which is
an open-source implementation of MapReduce written for
distributed-memory parallel machines on top of standard MPI message
passing.

"MapReduce"_wiki is the programming paradigm, popularized by Google,
which is widely used for processing large data sets in parallel.  Its
salient feature is that if a task can be formulated as a MapReduce,
the user can perform it in parallel without writing any parallel code.
Instead the user writes serial functions (maps and reduces) which
operate on portions of the data set independently.  The data-movement
and other necessary parallel operations can be performed in an
application-independent fashion, in this case by the MR-MPI library.

The MR-MPI library was developed at Sandia National Laboratories, a US
Department of Energy facility, for use on "informatics
problems"_informatics.  It includes C++ and C interfaces callable
from most hi-level languages, and also a Python wrapper and our own
"OINK scripting wrapper"_oinkdoc/Manual.html, which can be
used to develop and chain MapReduce operations together.  MR-MPI and
OINK are open-source codes, distributed freely under the terms of the
modified "Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) License"_bsd.  See
"this page"_open_source.html for more details.

The authors of the library are "Steve Plimpton"_sjp and "Karen
Devine"_kdd, who can be contacted at sjplimp at sandia.gov and kddevin
at sandia.gov.
