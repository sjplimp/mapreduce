<H3>MapReduce-MPI library features and non-features 
</H3>
<UL><LI>open-source C++ library
<LI>C interface provided, thus callable from any hi-level language: C++, C, Fortran, scripting language, etc
<LI>Python wrapper provided, so MapReduce programs can be written in Python
<LI>small, portable code base
<LI>operates in serial or on any parallel platform that supports MPI
<LI>operates in-core for data sets that fit in memory
<LI>operates out-of-core for data sets that do not 
</UL>
<UL><LI>no fault tolerance 
</UL>
<P>Fault tolerance is really an MPI issue, which future versions of MPI
may address.  Since big parallel machines never crash, nor do their
processors die, hopefully it's a non-issue for performing MapReduce
operations.
